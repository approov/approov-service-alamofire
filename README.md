# Approov Service for Alamofire 

A wrapper for the [Approov SDK](https://github.com/approov/approov-ios-sdk) to enable easy integration when using [`Alamofire`](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for making the API calls that you wish to protect with Approov. In order to use this you will need a trial or paid [Approov](https://www.approov.io) account.

Please follow the [Quickstart](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-ios-swift-alamofire) for instructions on usage.
